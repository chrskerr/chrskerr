### Hey Iâ€™m Chris ðŸ‘‹

I've been a software engineer for four years professionally, plus over a decade of other business experience, including a number of years in technical sales roles.

In my roles I have been responsible for code architecture, stakeholder communications, feature planning, driving the development of large features, and coaching junior developers. My business experience allows me to communicate effectively with non-technical stakeholders and with other engineers.

I know how to: 
- React
- Next.js
- Svelte & SvelteKit
- Node
- TypeScript
- Graphql & REST
- PostgresQL / SQL
- Stripe
- Three.js
- Plus a heap of other stuff
