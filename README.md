### Hey Iâ€™m Chris ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software engineer with three years professional programming experience, supported by over a decade of professional business experience, including a number of years in technical sales roles.

I am confident with both the technical and business aspects of engineering. In my current role I am responsible for code architecture for the business, as well as scoping, planning and execution of large features, and coaching our Junior developers. My business experience allows me to communicate with the broader team and allows me to take a more senior approach to my engineering.

I know how to: 
- React
- Next.js
- Svelte & SvelteKit
- Node
- TypeScript
- Graphql & REST
- PostgresQL / SQL
- Stripe
- Three.js
- Plus a heap of other stuff
