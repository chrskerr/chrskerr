### Chris Kerr 👋

I am a javascript software developer with a few years of coding experience and over 10 years experience in general IT and business settings.

My current professional focus is on React & Next.js, working on a number of concurrent freelance contracts. 

I know how to: 
- React
- Next.js
- Svelte & SvelteKit (beta)
- Node
- Graphql & REST
- PostgresQL / SQL
- Stripe
- Three.js
- Plus a heap of other stuff

#### Outside of work I'm currently:
- Building the beta of a community driven snorkelling, freediving & scuba dive site sharing page. The concept being that people can search and add their favourite locations, and help members of the community find interesting places to dive, especially while away from home. I'm trying right now to add augmented reality to the site so that they can see how the dive site fits around them. This is being built on React with Leaf & Three driving the mapping and beginnings of AR.
- Learning to mountain bike 🚲
- Teaching myself Tensorflow ML by building an automated trading bot 🤖
- Exploring Australia with my partner in a van 🚐
- And working from the road!
