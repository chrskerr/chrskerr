### Chris Kerr 👋

I am a new-ish javascript software developer with over 10 years experience in IT, technology, business, commerce and sales / relationship management.

My current professional focus is on React and Node, working in a now all-remote startup environment. I am working on external and internal facing React applications in close alignment with our graphic design team. 

I have experience with React, Node, Graphql, Postgresql, Stripe, Threejs, amongst many other toolkits.

Previously, I have worked in technical sales and relationship management roles, which helps me to understand development goals from both internal stakeholder and external customer perspectives. This is invaluable to me for appropriate internal communication, and helping me to guide development for best outcomes.

#### Outside of work I'm currently:
- Building the beta of a community driven snorkelling, freediving & scuba dive site sharing page. The concept being that people can search and add their favourite locations, and help members of the community find interesting places to dive, especially while away from home. I'm trying right now to add augmented reality to the site so that they can see how the dive site fits around them. This is being built on React with Leaf & Three driving the mapping and beginnings of AR.
- Learning to mountain bike 🚲
- Teaching myself Tensorflow ML by building an automated trading bot 🤖
- Exploring Australia with my partner in a van 🚐
- And working from the road!
