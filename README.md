### Chris Kerr ðŸ‘‹

I am a new-ish javascript software developer with over 10 years experience in IT, technology, business, commerce and sales / relationship management.

My current professional focus is on React and Node, working in a now all-remote startup environment. I am working on external and internal facing React applications in close alignment with our graphic design team. 

I have experience with React, Node, Graphql, Postgresql, Stripe, Threejs, amongst many other toolkits.

Previously, I have worked in technical sales and relationship management roles, which helps me to understand development goals from both internal stakeholder and external customer perspectives. This is invaluable to me for appropriate internal communication, and helping me to guide development for best outcomes.
